# Console
A comprehensive logging package for Luau, providing configurable logging levels, formatted output, ANSI color support (won't work in Roblox),
timestamps, and traceback integration - it's intention is to make what limited control we have over the output, easier to work with.

This console library implements the following APIs as to remain in parity with the following document:
	- https://www.sumologic.com/glossary/log-levels

See child pages for an example of how you can take advantage of this package.

## Functions
### setDefaults

> Console.setDefaults( `Configuration` \{ LogLevel: LogLevel?, Format: string?, Name: string?, Tracebacks: boolean?, Timestamps: boolean?, ANSI: boolean?, } ) ->  () 

Establishes the **global default configuration** for the Console logger.
These defaults apply to all scripts that use the Console package unless a script
explicitly overrides them using `Console.Configure()`.

### new

> Console.new( `name` [string](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/luau/strings), `Configuration` \{ LogLevel: LogLevel?, Format: string?, Name: string?, Tracebacks: boolean?, Timestamps: boolean?, ANSI: boolean?, }? ) ->  Logger 

Will instantiate a new console object, this is how you'll communicate with the 
console library.
