# Profile
The `Profile` class represents a camera wrapper that follows a basic lifecycle. These profiles are used with the `CameraProfiler`
system to manage multiple camera states in Roblox. Each profile is tied to a camera instance and can implement optional lifecycle
methods like `Construct`, `Start`, and `Stop`.

You can define custom profiles using `CameraProfiler:Profile()` and implementing optional methods for setup and teardown.

Example:
```lua
local MyProfile = CameraProfiler:Profile({
	Name = "MyCamera"
})

function MyProfile.Construct(self)
	print("Setup camera.")
end

function MyProfile.Start(self)
	print("Camera active.")
end

function MyProfile.Stop(self)
	print("Camera stopping.")
end

return MyProfile
```

## Properties
### Instance
> Profile.Instance  :: Camera

The actual `Camera` instance associated with this profile. This is the object that will be set as `workspace.CurrentCamera`
when the profile is activated.

### Name
> Profile.Name  :: [string](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/luau/strings)

The name of the camera profile. Used to identify and switch between profiles via `CameraProfiler:Set(name)`.

## Methods
### Construct

> Profile:Construct() -> [nil](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/luau/nil)

Optional lifecycle method.

Called once after the profile is created and added to the `CameraProfiler`. Use this for initialization logic such as
variable setup or preparing the camera instance.

---
### Start

> Profile:Start() -> [nil](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/luau/nil)

Optional lifecycle method.

Called when this camera profile becomes the active one (i.e., when `CameraProfiler:Set(name)` is called with this profile's name).
Used to begin camera behaviors or transitions.

---
### Stop

> Profile:Stop() -> [nil](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/luau/nil)

Optional lifecycle method.

Called when this camera profile is no longer the active camera. Used to clean up behaviors or reset state as needed.

---
### Destroy

> Profile:Destroy() -> [nil](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/luau/nil)

Removes this profile from the `CameraProfiler`. If it was the active camera, the profile's `Stop` lifecycle is called,
the `CameraStopped` signal is fired, and the active camera reference is cleared.
