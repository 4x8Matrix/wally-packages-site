# CameraProfiler
The Camera Profiler package represents a singleton that you can use to better leverage the Camera system wihin the Roblox Environment. This camera system
works through setting `Workspace.CurrentCamera` to the camera the developer wants to see.

Example of how you would create a profile
```lua
local BlimpCameraProfile = CameraProfiler:Profile({
	Name = "BlimpCamera"
})

function BlimpCameraProfile.Construct(self: BlimpCameraProfile)
	print("Setup blimp camera variables!")
end

function BlimpCameraProfile.Start(self: BlimpCameraProfile)
	print("Camera started, do things!")
end

function BlimpCameraProfile.Stop(self: BlimpCameraProfile)
	print("Camera stopped, clean things up!")
end

export type BlimpCameraProfile = typeof(BlimpCameraProfile)

return BlimpCameraProfile
```

Example of how you would use the newly created profile
```lua
CameraProfiler:Set("BlimpCamera")
```

Example of how you would integrate a Profile with the default Camera Roblox creates.
```lua
local DefaultCameraProfile = CameraProfiler:Profile({
	Name = "DefaultCamera"
}, workspace.CurrentCamera)
```

## Properties
### CameraStarted
> CameraProfiler.CameraStarted  :: Signal\<Name: string>

This signal is fired after a camera has started.

### CameraStopped
> CameraProfiler.CameraStopped  :: Signal\<Name: string>

This signal is fired after a camera has stopped.

## Methods
### Profile

> CameraProfiler:Profile( `profilePrototype` \{ Name: string, Construct: ((self: Profile) -> ())?, Start: ((self: Profile) -> ())?, Stop: ((self: Profile) -> ())?, }, `cameraInstance` Camera? ) ->  Profile 

Call this function to register your camera profile, a camera profile is a Roblox table that wraps around a camera instance, the goal of this table
	is to make interacting and handling with cameras easier within the engine.

Example:
```lua
local CameraProfile = CameraProfiler:Profile({
	Name = "CameraProfile"
})

function CameraProfile.Construct(self: CameraProfile)
	...
end

export type CameraProfile = typeof(CameraProfile)

return CameraProfile
```
