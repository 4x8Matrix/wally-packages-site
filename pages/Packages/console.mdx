# Console
A comprehensive logging package for Luau, providing configurable logging levels, formatted output, ANSI color support (won't work in Roblox),
timestamps, and traceback integration - it's intention is to make what limited control we have over the output, easier to work with.

This console library implements the following APIs as to remain in parity with the following document:
	- https://www.sumologic.com/glossary/log-levels

Simple usage of this library:
```luau
Console:Debug("This is a debug message.")
Console:Info("This is an informational message.")
Console:Warn("This is a warning!")
Console:Error("Something went wrong!")
```

Configuration of this library:
```luau
Console:Configure({
	LogLevel = "Info", -- Only show messages at Info level or higher
	Timestamps = true, -- Enable timestamps
	ANSI = true,       -- Enable ANSI colors (requires an ANSI-compatible console)
	Name = "MyAwesomeScript", -- Custom name for the logger instance
	Format = "[%*][%*][%*][%*]: %*%*%*" -- Custom format string (see Console.Configure for details)
})

Console:Debug("This debug message will not appear due to LogLevel configuration.")
Console:Info("This info message will appear with timestamp and ANSI colors.")
```

Advanced usage of this library:
```luau
Console:Debug("My Part:", workspace.Part)
Console:Info("Player Position:", game.Players.LocalPlayer.Character.HumanoidRootPart.Position)
Console:Warn("Configuration Table:", { enabled = true, maxAttempts = 5, data = { a = 1, b = "hello" } })
```

## Properties
## Methods
### Stringify

> Console:Stringify() -> [nil](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/luau/nil)

Will take a value, and return the stringified version of said value.

---
### Debug

> Console:Debug() -> [nil](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/luau/nil)

Debug logs are given the numerical value “7.” These logs typically contain information that is only useful
during the debug phase and may be of little value during production.

---
### Info

> Console:Info() -> [nil](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/luau/nil)

Informational logs are given the numerical value “6.” They include information about successful operations
within the application, such as a successful start, pause, or exit of the application.

---
### Notice

> Console:Notice() -> [nil](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/luau/nil)

Notice logs are given the numerical value “5.” They include information about events that may be unusual but
are not errors. Notice logs are technically normal, but still significant enough to have their own severity
level between information and warning.

---
### Warn

> Console:Warn() -> [nil](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/luau/nil)

Warning logs are given the numerical value “4.” Warning conditions are slightly less severe than error conditions.
Error conditions happen when an operation fails, while a warning might indicate that an operation will fail in the
future if action is not taken now.

---
### Error

> Console:Error() -> [nil](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/luau/nil)

Error logs are given the numerical value “3.” This category is assigned to event logs that contain an application
error message.

---
### Critical

> Console:Critical() -> [nil](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/luau/nil)

Critical logs are given the numerical value “2.” This category is assigned for critical errors, such as hardware
failure.

---
### Alert

> Console:Alert() -> [nil](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/luau/nil)

Alert logs are given the numerical value “1.” This category is assigned when an event log requires an immediate
response, such as when a system database becomes corrupted and must be restored to prevent the loss of critical
data or services.

---
### Emergency

> Console:Emergency() -> [nil](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/luau/nil)

Emergency logs are given the numerical value “0”. This category is assigned when an event log indicates that the
system is completely unusable.

---
### Configure

> Console:Configure() -> [nil](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/luau/nil)

Configures the logging behavior specifically for the **calling script**.
Each script maintains its own configuration, allowing for granular control over its logging output.
Settings applied here will override any global defaults set by `Console.SetDefaults`.

---
## Functions
### setDefaults

> Console.setDefaults() -> [nil](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/luau/nil)

Establishes the **global default configuration** for the Console logger.
These defaults apply to all scripts that use the Console package unless a script
explicitly overrides them using `Console.Configure()`.

---
### new

> Console.new() -> [nil](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/luau/nil)

Will instantiate a new console object, this is how you'll communicate with the 
console library.
